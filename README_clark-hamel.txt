Site was completely revamped and made far simpler in order to accommodate my
elementary level programming.

Bugs:
I would like to be able to toggle the results of the buttons starting with "show."
If I were to toggle the results, the results would show up when the page is loaded
and then they could be hidden and then shown again. I would prefer for them to
be hidden to start and then toggle on. The only way I was able to do that was to
use the myFunction. Unfortunately, then I had to create the "hide/show" button to
toggle them off again.

To Do:
Connect database so that it can be accessed via site.
Once that is done, I'll need to completely revamp the site.
